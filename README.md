This is my latest project build with Meteor.js platform. Its a recipe sharing application where you can see other users submitted recipes can review and rate them and can also share your own recipes.After learning basics of Meteor i decided to made an application from scratch as i always find it great learning experience to make some thing from ground to deepen my knowledge about that particular language or framework. This application has user accounts and has features of router, uploading images, up votes , making comments and adding ratings.This application was my experiment lab as all the things i was learning about Meteor i was experimenting them with this application and now final version is ready.
